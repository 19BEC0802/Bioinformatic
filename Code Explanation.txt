Explanation of the Code:

1. Imports:
subprocess: To run shell commands (alignments and SAMtools).
time: To measure execution times.
pandas: For storing and handling results.
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: For creating visualizations.

2. Functions:
run_alignment: Runs the alignment command and measures execution time.
get_alignment_stats: Extracts alignment statistics using SAMtools.
extract_aligned_reads: Parses the SAMtools output to get the number of aligned reads.

3. Running Alignments:
Calls bwa_align.sh and novo_align.sh scripts for BWA and NoVoAlign alignments, respectively.
Measures execution time for each.

4. Performance Metrics:
Calculates accuracy and error rates based on the number of aligned reads.
Memory usage values are placeholders (adjust based on actual measurements).

5. Visualization:
Plots for execution time, memory usage, accuracy, and error rates using Seaborn.
Saves the results to a CSV file for future reference.


Dependencies:
Make sure the following are installed before running the script:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bwa novocraft samtools python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Running the Script:
Ensure bwa_align.sh and novo_align.sh scripts are executable:

chmod +x bwa_align.sh novo_align.sh


Run the Python script:
python3 alignment_comparison.py
